## ⚙️ Project Setup & Important Notes

> Before running FriendNest, make sure you configure the following:

- 🔐 **Add your hCaptcha Secret Key**  
  Set your own secret key for hCaptcha in `includes/config.php` to secure the registration page.

- 👤 **Set Admin Account**  
  After creating a user account, manually set `"role": admin` in `data/users.json` for that user to enable Admin Panel access.

- 📰 **Customize News Feed**  
  Modify the RSS feed source in `fetch_news.php` to reflect the type of news you want your community to see.

- 🌍 **Set Your Timezone**  
  Update the $timezone = new DateTimeZone(''); to match your region.

- 🛠 **Make It Yours**  
  Feel free to fork and customize the project. Add new features, themes, integrations — anything you like!

## 📦 Storage Approach: Why JSON?

FriendNest currently uses **JSON-based storage** rather than a database like MySQL.  
This decision was made to keep the project lightweight and accessible to beginners, making it easier to:
- Read and edit data manually.
- Deploy the platform without complex setup.
- Prototype and iterate quickly.

As the project grew, JSON storage was retained to lower the barrier for contribution and testing. However, migrating to a full database system is totally supported and encouraged for larger-scale implementations.
